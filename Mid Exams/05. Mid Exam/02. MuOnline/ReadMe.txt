You have initial health 100 and initial bitcoins 0. You will be given a string representing the dungeon's rooms. Each room is separated with '|' (vertical bar): "room1|room2|room3…"
Each room contains a command and a number, separated by space. The command can be:
•	"potion"
o	You are healed with the number in the second part. But your health cannot exceed your initial health (100).
o	First print: "You healed for {amount} hp."
o	After that, print your current health: "Current health: {health} hp."
•	"chest"
o	You've found some bitcoins, the number in the second part.
o	Print: "You found {amount} bitcoins."
•	In any other case, you are facing a monster, which you will fight. The second part of the room contains the attack of the monster. You should remove the monster's attack from your health. 
o	If you are not dead (health <= 0), you've slain the monster, and you should print: "You slayed {monster}."
o	If you've died, print "You died! Killed by {monster}." and your quest is over. Print the best room you've manage to reach: "Best room: {room}"

"You've made it!"
"Bitcoins: {bitcoins}"
