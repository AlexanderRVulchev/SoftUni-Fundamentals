Input
•	Read from the console a single line holding space-separated integers.
Output
•	Print the above-described numbers on a single line, space-separated. 
•	If less than 5 numbers hold the property mentioned above, print less than 5 numbers. 
•	Print "No" if no numbers hold the above property.
Constraints
•	All input numbers are integers in the range [-1 000 000 … 1 000 000]. 
•	The count of numbers is in the range [1…10 000].
