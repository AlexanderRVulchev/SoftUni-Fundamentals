You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements after receiving the following commands:
•	"swap {index1} {index2}" takes two elements and swap their places.
•	"multiply {index1} {index2}" takes element at the 1st index and multiply it with the element at 2nd index. Save the product at the 1st index.
•	"decrease" decreases all elements in the array with 1.
Input
On the first input line, you will be given the initial array values separated by a single space.
On the next lines you will receive commands until you receive the command "end". The commands are as follow: 
•	"swap {index1} {index2}"
•	"multiply {index1} {index2}"
•	"decrease"
Output
The output should be printed on the console and consist of elements of the modified array – separated by a comma and a single space ", ".
Constraints
•	Elements of the array will be integer numbers in the range [-231...231]
•	Count of the array elements will be in the range [2...100]
•	Indexes will be always in the range of the array
