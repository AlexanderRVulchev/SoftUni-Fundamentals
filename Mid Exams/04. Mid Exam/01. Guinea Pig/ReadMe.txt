On the first three lines, you will receive the quantity of food, hay, and cover, which Merry buys for a month (30 days). On the fourth line, you will receive the guinea pig's weight.
Every day Puppy eats 300 gr of food. Every second day Merry first feeds the pet, then gives it a certain amount of hay equal to 5% of the rest of the food. On every third day, Merry puts Puppy cover with a quantity of 1/3 of its weight.
Calculate whether the quantity of food, hay, and cover, will be enough for a month.
If Merry runs out of food, hay, or cover, stop the program!
