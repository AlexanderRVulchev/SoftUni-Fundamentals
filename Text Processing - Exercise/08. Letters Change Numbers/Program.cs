//Nakov likes Math. But he also likes the English alphabet. He invented a game with numbers and letters from the English alphabet.
//The game was simple. You get a string consisting of a number between two letters.
//Depending on whether the letter was in front of the number or after it,
//you would perform different mathematical operations on the number to achieve the result.
//First, you start with the letter before the number. 
//•	If it's uppercase you divide the number by the letter's position in the alphabet. 
//•	If it's lowercase you multiply the number with the letter's position in the alphabet. 
//Then you move to the letter after the number. 
//•	If it's uppercase you subtract its position from the resulted number.
//•	If it's lowercase you add its position to the resulted number.
//But the game became too easy for Nakov.
//He decided to complicate it a bit by doing the same but with multiple strings keeping track of only the total sum of all results.
//Once he started to solve this with more strings and bigger numbers, it became quite hard to do it only in his mind.
//So he kindly asks you to write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers after the operations on each number have been done.
//For example, you are given the sequence "A12b s17G":
//We have two strings – "A12b" and "s17G". We do the operations on each and sum them.
//We start with the letter before the number on the first string. A is Uppercase and its position in the alphabet is 1.
//So we divide the number 12 with position 1 (12/1 = 12).
//Then we move to the letter after the number. b is lowercase and its position is 2. So we add 2 to the resulting number (12+2=14).
//Similarly for the second string s is lowercase and its position is 19 so we multiply it with the number(17 * 19 = 323).
//Then we have Uppercase G with position 7, so we subtract it from the resulted number(323 – 7 = 316).
//Finally, we sum the 2 results and we get 14 + 316 = 330.
//Input
//The input comes from the console as a single line, holding the sequence of strings.Strings are separated by one or more white spaces.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described.There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//Print at the console a single number: the total sum of all processed numbers rounded up to two digits after the decimal separator.
//Constraints
//•	The count of the strings will be in the range[1…10].
//•	The numbers between the letters will be integers in the range[1…2147483647].
//•	Time limit: 0.3 sec.Memory limit: 16 MB.
